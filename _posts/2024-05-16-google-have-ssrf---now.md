I recently landed on the Google site "appsheet.com", which is a Google `no-code app builder`, from one of the other google sites (apigee).

From a simple look through the site, it has [this URL](https://www.appsheet.com/Account/AddSource) (you can navigate there from "My account"â†’"New Data Source"), which lets you connect to a remote database. You have 12 choices, and three of them caught my eye:

1. OData (Beta)
2. On-premises Database
3. Cloud Database (i.e. SQL database)

All of which let the user input a URL to connect to.

So, I set up my [webhook.site](https://webhook.site), and I started experimenting:

## SSRF
\[explanation what is ssrf [here](https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf)]
### Endpoints
I didn't succeed with the "Cloud Database", but in the other two SSRF works, with almost no limitations:

* On both, the URL `127.0.0.1` \[or `localhost`] results in `Cannot assign requested address [::1]`.
* The odata endpoint can only be HTTPS. ("for security reasons"). Redirects are not followed.

The Odata option can result in mainly 4 states:

* `SSL connection could not be established` - http server \[e.g. https://metadata]
* `Name or service not known` - invalid domains, IPs and localhost
* `No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it` - closed ports. This is very slow.

I guess at this stage I could try to scan the internal network, but the API is very slow, especially when most of the IPs are going to fall into the `target machine actively refused` category.

The `on-promise` option is more blind but has even fewer limitations:
it's meant to connect with [DreamFactory](https://www.dreamfactory.com) servers,
You can use both HTTP and HTTPS. Other protocols results in asp.net error like this one:

```cs
Unable to cast object of type 'System.Net.FtpWebRequest' to type 'System.Net.HttpWebRequest'.
```
### Information Disclose
When I sent some HTTP requests to my webhook.site, I saw some weird headers.

Turns out, if you send the same **HTTP** request **twice**, it will be requested from the proxy, in this case, [envoy proxy](https://www.envoyproxy.io).
Due to a [misconfiguration](https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000135744), envoy sends the headers `X-envoy-peer-metadata`, and `x-envoy-peer-metadata-id`.

The metadata-id contains `sidecar~10.32.xx.xxx~appsheet-server-cxfxxxd.appsheet~appsheet.svc.cluster.local` but second header (`X-envoy-peer-metadata`), which is base64 encoded, includes a surprising amount of information:

```yml

gcp_project_number: 10xxxxx
WORKLOAD_NAME: appshet-server
```

(I did censor the information, but at the time of writing this anyone can just get this info)

## Google

I reported it to google.
Sometimes you [get lucky](/common-google-xss), sometimes not. This time, google closed my report with "Intended Behavior"

I hope you enjoyed the article, and enjoyed this hidden intended feature of the appsheet :)
