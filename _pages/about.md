I started programming in MIT-Scratch at age 11. I programmed a bit in Processing and then I discovered Python and created a number of libraries and programs in Python. Later I heard about rust, and I tried simple (or exciting and complicated) projects to learn it. Lately I am also programming in JavaScript in Electron for cross platform desktop development. I also like cybersecurity â€“ I play CTF about once a month.

I also like music (especially John Williams and Michael Giacchino) and play the piano and the clarinet. I also like abstract photography.
