# Special pages

* [private-convert](https://matan-h.com/private-convert): A full site to convert media locally in the browser. I've set a [custom GitHub Pages workflow](.github/workflows/pages.yml) that downloads the last zip build from my [`private-convert`](https://github.com/matan-h/private-convert)  GitHub project and put it in the root folder.

* [visual sitemap](https://matan-h.com/vsitemap): An automatic liquid Visual Sitemap, that uses a modified version of [mattbrailsford/css-sitemap](https://github.com/mattbrailsford/css-sitemap/blob/master/sitemap.css) to make the sitemap look like blocks.

* [/random](https://matan-h.com/random): A liquid-built, random post redirect page. It uses Liquid to build a list of posts, then JavaScript to choose a random one and redirect to it.

* [python-editor](https://matan-h.com/python-editor): An HTML page (written in the "[python-editor.md](_pages/python-editor.md)" file) that uses [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org) to run Python code online. it supports my libraries, so it has a [Hebrew-python](https://github.com/matan-h/hebrew-python) mode. 

* [home gallery](https://matan-h.com): An automatic liquid-built gallery of my posts, each with a date and featuring image.

* [404 page](https://matan-h.com/404): A single HTML file that looks like Python cgitb error and can lead you to one or more of those special pages.
